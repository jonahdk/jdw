<h1>Jonah's Dog Walking Service</h1>

<p>
  This is Jonah, and this is my brand new site! If you want an appointment click <a href="https://forms.gle/CfAxKS2gSc61GBUM7" target="_blank">here</a>
</p>

<p>
  I only walk dogs in Barton Glen. If you do not live in Barton Glen then I cannot serve you.
  My prices are depending on how long the walk is. It is 50 cents per minute. ($2.50 for 5 minutes, $5 for 10 minutes, etc.) I accept cash only. I do not accept credit/debit cards or Paypal yet.
  I know the site doesn't look like much at all, but that is because I am still learning code.
When I learn more code, I will definitely make this site much much better.
