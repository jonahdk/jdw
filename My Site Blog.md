# My Site
December 2nd 2020 <br>
Hello! This is the blog on my site! So far I've had the site for almost a month, and its going pretty well. This is also my very first site, so I'm hoping it does good. Today, I added my very first embed. The embed was for a form related to the site that I made. I created the site on November 4th and gtot a custom domain on November 7th. There is not much more to say, so see you tomorrow!

I added a webhook! Whenever I update the repo, I have it post saying that I updated in a Discord Server! Isn't that cool?? Anyway, theres nothing else I've done today, or even since the 2nd. Heheh. Anyway, see you next time!

I finally deleted the notice that we are temporarily closed because I have tested positive for COVID-19. Nothing else to say, except that those puppies are adorable! Alright, goodbye!
