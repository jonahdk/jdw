# My Site
December 2nd 2020 <br>
Hello! This is the blog on my site! So far I've had the site for almost a month, and its going pretty well. This is also my very first site, so I'm hoping it does good. Today, I added my very first embed. The embed was for a form related to the site that I made. I created the site on November 4th and gtot a custom domain on November 7th. There is not much more to say, so see you tomorrow!
